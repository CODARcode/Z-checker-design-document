\section{Design}

We introduce the design framework and some implementation details.

\subsection{Overview}
In this paper, we present Z-checker, a novel framework with three important features. (1) Z-checker can be used to explore the properties of original data sets for the purpose of data analytics or improvement of lossy compression algorithms. (2) Z-checker is integrated with a rich set of evaluation algorithms and assessment functions for selecting best-fit lossy compressors for specific data sets. (3) Z-checker features both static data visualization scripts and an interactive visualization system, which can generate visual results on demand. This interactive mode allows compression algorithm developers and users to compute dynamically analysis on user-selected portions of the data set.

Z-checker is designed to support two processing modes, on-line and off-line, and two display modes, static and interactive. The four modes correspond to four different use cases. The off-line static mode is useful for generating a report on the original data set properties and the compression error, presenting multiple analysis views. The off-line interactive mode is useful for exploring the properties of the original data sets and the compression error. It allows users to dig into some region of interest and reveal local properties that are not present or visible on the whole data set. The on-line static display mode corresponds to in situ data compression and may generate and update the original data set compression analysis as long as the data is presented to Z-checker. The on-line interactive mode allows users to monitor the compression error while the data is produced. Users can zoom in on regions of interest and assess the quality of the data compression. Table \ref{tab:modes} summarizes the four use cases of Z-checker, considering the two processing modes and two visualization modes.

\caption{Design Architecture of Z-checker}
\label{fig:framework}
\end{figure}

The design architecture of Z-checker is presented in Figure \ref{fig:framework}, which involves three critical parts: \emph{user interface},  \emph{processing module}, and \emph{data module}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{User interface} includes three key engines---input engine, output engine, and data visualization engine---as shown in the light-gray rectangles in Figure \ref{fig:framework}. They are in charge of reading the floating-point data stream (either original data or compressed bytes), dumping the analyzed data to disks/PFS, and plotting data figures for visualizing analysis results. The Data visualization engine also provides the interactive mode through a web browser interface (details are described later).
\item \emph{Processing module}, in the whole framework, is the core module, which includes the analysis kernel and configuration parser. The former is responsible for performing the critical analysis, and the latter is in charge of parsing the user's analysis requirements (such as specifying input file path, specifying the compression command or executable, and customizing the analysis metrics on demand). Specifically, the analysis kernel is composed of two critical submodules, the data property analyzer and compression checker, which are responsible for exploring data properties based on the original data sets and analyzing the compression results with specified lossy compressors (discussed later in more detail).
\item \emph{Data source module} (shown as the dark-gray box in the figure) is the bottom layer in the whole framework and represents the data source (such as data stream produced by scientific applications at runtime or the data files stored in the disks).
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Terminology}

\begin{description}

\item[Application:] An executable program with a specific science purpose and a
designated input and output format. A given application may have multiple
executables for different target architectures and for testing different
compiler optimizations, but each such executable must have consistent
parameter, input, and output formats.

\item[Application run:] A run of an application with a given set of parameters

\item[Lossy compressors:] The library that provides lossy compression ability for scientific data sets. The science data includes different types, such as integer, single-precision and double-precision floating-point data. A lossy compressor should provide both executables and APIs for different users to call the lossy compression functions. A good lossy compressor should also provide multiple options for users to control compression errors, and it should respect the compression errors based on specified error-controlling. 

\item[Compression quality:] Compression quality includes compression ratio, bit-rate, compression time, decompression time, data distortion, rate-distortion, and so on. Compression ratio is defined as the ratio of the original raw data size to the the size of the compressed data. Bit-rate refers to the number of bits used to represent one data point after the compression. Hence, bit-rate is equal to the ratio of the number of bits used by one data point originally (e.g., 64 for double-precision floating-point data) to the compression ratio. compression time and decompression time are usually evaluated by compression rate and decompression rate respectively. Compression rate is the ratio of the original raw data size (in MB) to the compression time (in seconds). The decompression rate is the ratio of the original raw data size (in MB) to the decompression time (in seconds). Data distortion involves a set of distortion metrics such as maximum compression errors, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Rate distortion is a common metric to evaluate the compression quality. Rate, here, means the bit-rate; distortion refers to PSNR. 


\item[Offline analysis:] Offline analysis means that given specific raw data files, compressed data files, and/or decompressed data files, Z-checker is able to perform the analysis and generate the report. 

\item[Online analysis:] Online analysis means that Z-checker will be integrated into other tools or applications, performing the analysis with the running of applications, and generating the assessment report in the end. 

\end{description}

\subsection{Dependencies}

Some functionalities of Z-checker depends on third-party libraries, which are listed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Support MPI library: ./configure --prefix=[install\_dir] --enable-mpi . (The user needs to install mpi library such as mpich before hand.)
\item Support NetCDF : usage can be found in the subdirectory NetCDFReader/ (./configure --prefix=[install\_dir] --enable-netcdf --with-netcdf-prefix=DIR; NetCDF needs to be installed in advance.)
\item Support HDF5 library: details can be found in HDF5Reader/ (./configure --prefix=[install\_dir] --enable-hdf5; the user needs to install HDF5 and set its environment variables according to HDF5 guide before hand.)
<<<<<<< HEAD
\item Support FFTW3 library: computation of 3D auto correlation requires FFTW3. In particular, 3D auto correlation is computed by using some functions provided by FFTW3. (./configure --prefix=[indall\_dir] --enable-fftw3 --with-fftw3-prefix=DIR; the user ndeeds to install FFTW3 before hand.)

\item Support R language/library: the functions coded in R script can be executed in the data analysis and compression analysis. In particular, SSIM function is coded in R, so it requires R library in Z-checker. (./configure --prefix=[index\_dir] --enable-r --with-r-prefix=DIR)
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the user can also use --with-xxx-include-path and --with-xxx-lib-path to specify the header directory and lib directory, respectively, instead of --with-xxx-prefix. More options can be found by executing "./configure -help".

2. varCmpr.info (specifying the data files to be involved in the assessment)

3. errBounds.cfg (specifying the error bounds used in the assessment)

This configuration is used by only One-command assessment of Z-checker-installer.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellStyleInline, basicstyle =\footnotesize\ttfamily]

\subsection{output directory layout}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellStyleInline, basicstyle =\footnotesize\ttfamily]

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{One-command installation and usage}

We provide a very easy-to-use way for users to install and use Z-checker, by leveraging Z-checker-installer. In Z-checker-installer, one user can perform only one command (i.e., z-checker-install.sh) to install every related depending package or libraries, such as SZ, ZFP, gnuplot, latex. After the simple installation, the user just needs to execute two commands to finish the complete assessment procedure for a given data set. (1) Executing \emph{createZCCase.sh} can generate an individual workspace based on the user's specified test case name. (2) Executing \emph{runZCCase.sh} will perform the compression automatically by different compressors such as SZ and ZFP, and finally generate the assessment report with narratives and figures insides.
in the future, If the user wants to update his/her package based on the already installed z-checker-installer, he/she can execute one command z-checker-update.sh for simplicity, instead of rerunning z-checker-install.sh.

Both Z-checker tool and Z-checker-installer package will be put in Spack later.

\subsection{A typical test plan}

This example describes how to generate data property analysis results and compression results, given original data files (in binary), compressed files and decompressed files.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ShellStyleInline, basicstyle =\footnotesize\ttfamily]

#Use createOfflineCase.sh to create a use-case directory, which will contain 
#all the executables. Then, do the following steps.
#Preparing the testing data
.1. Download the testing data from here:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~shdi/download/runOfflineCase_testdata.tar.gz
#Tips: the testing data package contains two original data files and their 
#corresponding SZ-compressed files and decompressed files based on different 
#error bounds
.2. tar -xzvf runOfflineCase_testdata.tar.gz

#Generate the property analysis results and compression results
.3. ./createOfflineCase.sh testcase1
.4. cd testcase1
.5. ./runOfflineCase -C varCmpr.inf -A -N sz
#Tips: More options can be shown by executing ./runOfflineCase without any input 
#options; in the above example, we set the compress name as "sz" because the 
#compressed/decompressed data files were generated by sz.

#Generate figures based on the property/compression results in form of GNUPlot
.6. Edit zc.config as follows:
    compressors = sz:[the absolute path of the directory of the test case]
#Tips: sz here refers to the compressor name. You can replace it by your 
#own compressor
    comparisonCases = sz(1E-3)
.7. ./generateGNUPlot zc.config
#Then, you can find rate-distortion eps files generated in the current directory.
#More information can be found in the doc/userguide.pdf
#Tips: You can run the executables or scripts without any inputs to see 
#the help information
\end{lstlisting}
