\section{Metrics}

The purpose of Z-checker is to perform all the compression-related assessment on real science applications
to allow the developers to select either the best-fit compressors for specific applications or improve the compression quality, particularly on 
exascale architectures. The metrics will be the number of applications assessable by Z-checker, the number of I/O libraries Z-checker supports, our understanding of the compression quality based on Z-checker, and our success at improving compressors.
