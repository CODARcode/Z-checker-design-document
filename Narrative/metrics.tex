\section{Metrics}

The purpose of Z-checker is to perform all the compression-related assessment simply on real science applications
that allow the developers to select the best-fit compressors for specific applications or improve the compression quality, particularly on new
Exascale machines. The metrics will be the number of applications we can assess by Z-checker, the number of I/O libraries Z-checker supports, how much we can understand the compression quality based on Z-checker, and how successful we are at helping improve each compressor.
