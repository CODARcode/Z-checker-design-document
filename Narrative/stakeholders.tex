\section{Stakeholders}

We list here potential stakeholders for this software and the results of any consultations that we have had with those stakeholders in developing this design document.

\subsection{Exascale applications}

ECP application (AD) projects demanding lossy compression techniques are a primary source of the problems that Z-checker is designed to address.
We have consulted with many, but certainly not all, ECP AD teams to understand their requirement on data compression.

\subsection{Software technologies}

ECP software technology (ST) projects such as ADIOS, SZ, ZFP, Cinema, ALPINE, VTK-m, and Spack
are all potential contributors of software components that may be integrated into the Z-checker assessment tool. 
Up to now (Jan. 2018), SZ and ZFP have been integrated into Z-checker. Z-checker has been integrated into ADIOS to a certain extent. 
For other projects/software components, we need to understand any constraints or special requirements that they may impose.
We intend to consult with many of those projects in the future.
