\section{Possible future directions}

\emph{This section is for ideas that we think are worth pursuing but do not fit in the current design.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Maintain a database of experiments and/or results of experiment runs. This
could be a local database limited only to the current user and machine, or
a shared server supporting many users and many applications. Initially
Cheetah will generate standard layout output directories that can be organized
by the user as they see fit.

\item
Support multiple executables, to allow testing options that can only be set at
compile time. This should cover many cases of compile time options, but it may
be awkward when performing experiments with a large number of compile time
options. If such experiments prove to be common, we can consider adding support
for compiling applications as part of the Cheetah harness.
\end{itemize}
